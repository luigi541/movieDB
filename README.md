# movieDB
My very first responsive web application, that can browse the latest releases and movie details, featuring an interactive design. Built as a learning project to practice JavaScript and API integration.


JavaScript(vanilla), REST API, HTML5, CSS3.


MovieDataBase API


**View in Browser**
   - Locate `movieDataBase.html` in your project folder.
   - Double-click `movieDataBase.html` to open it in your default browser.
   - Alternatively, right-click the file in VS Code and select **"Open with Live Server"** (if you have the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) installed).
     
 **Usage**
   - The main page (`movieDataBase.html`) lets you search for movies and view popular movies.
   - Click on a movie to see its details. This will open `movieDetails.html` with the movieâ€™s information.
